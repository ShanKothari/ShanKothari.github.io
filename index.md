Since Fall 2014, I have been a PhD student in the [Cavender-Bares Lab](https://cbs.umn.edu/cavender-bares-lab/home) at University of Minnesota. Before that, I did my undergraduate work at Michigan State University.

This website is still under construction, but please poke back around later to see what I'm working on!

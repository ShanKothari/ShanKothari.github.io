Since Fall 2020, I've been a postdoctoral researcher in Etienne Laliberté's lab at Université de Montréal as part of the Canadian Airborne Biodiversity Observatory. Before, I did my PhD in the [Cavender-Bares Lab](https://cbs.umn.edu/cavender-bares-lab/home) at University of Minnesota.

I'm an ecophysiologist and community ecologist with a particular interest in the ways plants respond to their light environment. Much of my research concerns the dual role of light as both an essential resource and a potential stressor for plants. Most recently, I've been curious about the influence of light as a factor that influences the timing and pattern of leaf senescence in deciduous trees.

I also think about light as a tool to understand other aspects of plant function. In my current position, I work to describe and interpret the range of functional variation in plant reflectance spectra, which could help researchers monitor plant communities from space.

Since Fall 2014, I have been a PhD student in the [Cavender-Bares Lab](https://cbs.umn.edu/cavender-bares-lab/home) at University of Minnesota. Before that, I did my undergraduate work at Michigan State University. In Fall 2020, I will be joining Etienne Laliberté's lab at Université de Montréal.

I am an ecophysiologist and community ecologist with a particular interest in the ways plants respond to their light environment. My research concerns the dual role of light as both an essential resource and a potential stressor for plants. I also use spectroscopy and remote sensing to help me understand how plants work at large scales.

Since Fall 2020, I've been a postdoctoral researcher in Etienne Laliberté's lab at Université de Montréal as part of the Canadian Airborne Biodiversity Observatory. Before, I did my PhD in the [Cavender-Bares Lab](https://cbs.umn.edu/cavender-bares-lab/home) at University of Minnesota.

I'm an ecophysiologist and community ecologist with a particular interest in the ways plants respond to their light environment. My PhD research concerned the dual role of light as both an essential resource and a potential stressor for plants. My main concern in my current job is to describe the range of functional variation in plant reflectance spectra, which could help researchers monitor plant communities from space. I'm also pursuing a longstanding interest in the physiological drivers of leaf senescence timing.
